# Sequences extension for 3D Slicer

Repository to host Sequences (formerly MultidimData) extension for Slicer versions 4.10 and earlier.

This repository is archived. Sequences extension modules have been integrated into Slicer core in Slicer-4.11 and source code is maintained there (in [Sequences](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/tree/master/Modules/Loadable/Sequences) module). Sequences extension does not need to be installed for Slicer-4.11 and later versions.
